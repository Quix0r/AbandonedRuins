---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.18
Date: 2025-08-06
  Bugfixes:
    - need to run `init()` also during `on_load` as `spawn_changes` and others are now moved away,
      thanks to @Silly_Warlock for mentioning this
  Minor:
    - introduced wrapper function `utils.output_message()` to avoid crashes due to missing `game`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.17
Date: 2025-08-06
  Features:
    - added remote-call function "register_ruin_set" which wraps around same function in file
      `lua/utilities.lua`. So no need to `require()` that script anymore
  Minor:
    - moved `storage.exclusive_ruinset` to `spawning` "class/library" to clear some space in
      game-save file (storage is persisted)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.16
Date: 2025-08-05
  Minor:
    - Added deprecation message so the player can see it, including ruin-set name
    - reformatted some debug lines
    - renamed `recipe` to `recipe_name` as this is only the name and not full `LuaRecipe`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.15
Date: 2025-08-05
  Bugfixes:
    - tpzo fixed in variable name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.14
Date: 2025-08-04
  Minor:
    - moved `spawn_chances` table from storage to local lua/spawning.lua "class'" property
    - moved `ruin_sizes` table to lua/spawning.lua` "class`" property
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.13
Date: 2025-08-03
  Performance:
    - `on_tick` was to much, now it can be configured how often a ruin should be attempted to spawn
  Rewrites:
    - moved queue (ruins) handling to own LUA "class/library"
    - moved excluding/reincluding surfaces to own LUA "class/library"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.12
Date: 2025-08-03
  Bugfixes:
    - when no ruin-set is installed the default was "base" which is already a ruin-set's name
    - replacing "base" with "__none__" and then excluding it from being handled solves a crash
      reported by @sidfu1 and confirmed by @xyzzycgn
  Minor:
    - added more paths (e.g. `.DS_Store` is from MacOS) to be ignored
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.11
Date: 2025-07-27
  Bugfixes:
    - skip creating debug world surface when no ruin-set was loaded (e.g. only this mod installed)
    - local variable `mgs` was pointless as it only caused more memory usage and was used only once
    - moved `excluded_surfaces` to temporary local variable, it shouldn't be persisted or else
      I cannot add new internal surfaces easily.
    - added more checks on array elements to avoid crashes with `?` and `nil` only which are
      hard to debug
    - handle missing ruin-set while it is still configured. This might be the case when a mod
      failed to properly load its ruin-sets
    - use constants.ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG_KEY instead of hard-coded string (recommended for mod devs)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.10
Date: 2025-07-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Event registrations can only be one function at a time. So if you register two to the
      same event the later one overwrites the other one, thanks to @Silly_Warlock pointing this
      out
  Minor:
    - added function name to error messages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.9
Date: 2025-07-27
  Features:
    - `add_ruin_size()` now has a 2nd parameter, `half_size` (uint) which will be added/updated
      in table `utils.ruin_half_sizes`
    - added another debug message
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed logic error in fluid handling in `safe_insert_fluid()`, thanks to @Silly_Warlock
      pointing it out
    - got rid of local copies of `prototypes.fluid` and `entity.insert_fluid()`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.8
Date: 2025-07-24
  Features:
    - Allow ruin-set mods to mark their whole mod exclusively to one or more surfaces
    - introduced `utils.get_ruin_name()` which will return "unknown" if the ruin doesn't have
      a key "name" set or otherwise that key is returned
  Minor:
    - added surface "NiceFill" to excluded surfaces as this is only an "internal"
      hidden surface
    - more/improved debug messages like ruin-set's name
  Documentation:
    - removed `docs/ruin_sets.md` as its place is now in `AbandonedRuins-base` mod
    - updated link to github's "blob" URL
    - updated links to updated `ruin-maker` mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.7
Date: 2025-07-22
  Rewrites:
    - some ruins might contain only tiles to spawn (e.g. `heart.lua` in "base"). They are now
      correctly spawned (thanks to @Silly_Warlock for reporting this)
    - only invoke `spawn_entities()` when there is something to spawn
  Minor:
    - `spawn_ruin()`: logged amount of variables about to be parsed, entities and tiles about
      to be spawned
    - logging `table_size(ruin.entities)` might crash the game as it might be `nil` again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.6
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfix for bugfix:
    - ops!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.5
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfixes:
    - cannot log `entity.name` as the parameter `entity` might be a string, too ... :-(
    - reverted back last change ... (?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.4
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfixes:
    - `settings.global` isn't available during "settings" phase, it has to be
      `data.raw["string-setting"]` for `current-ruin-set` setting.
    - entities need to be destroyed regardless if they are valid or not
    - still logging an invalid entity isn't possible, so logging needs to distinguish this
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.3
Date: 2025-07-22
  Features:
    - moved `register_ruin_set()` from non-working `remote.call()` to `lua/utilities.lua`.
      You now have to "include" that script instead. See mod `realistic-ruins-updated` for
      an example.
  Documentation:
    - moved `format.md` to `AbandonedRuins-base` as that is the proper place it
    - updated other documentation files for reflecting the split of the mods
  Bugfixes:
    - Need to add previous size's threshold, not current again (thanks to @Silly_Warlock for
      reporting this
    - my debug message crashed the game when logging `entity.type/name` when an invalid entity
      was found
    - added braces to `count_tiles_filtered()` invocation as this is a function to be invoked
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 2025-07-21
  Features:
    - added remote-call function `register_ruin_set` for avoiding hard-coded access on writing
      mod configuration in other mods (lesser porting)
  Improvements/bugfixes:
    - used more `table_size(my_table)` as `#my_table` is undecided size LUA 5.2
    - fixed all `default-ruin-set` to `current-ruin-set`
    - added more debug lines
    - used counter variable for indexed (numeric) tables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2025-07-20
  Changes:
    - fixed bug in `spawn_ruin()` as the keyword `local` was twice, causing the variable's scope
      being intitialized again inside the `if()` block and the outside variable is NOT updated
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - renamed mod to `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` done by @Keysivi
    - renamed settings from `AbandonedRuins-*` to `ruins-*`, `current-ruin-set` is now where other
      ruin-sets can be added to
    - removed base ruins (duplicated to mod `AbandonedRuins-base`)
    - further rewrites towards `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` mod
    - excluded my old mod's name
    - added asserts on surface.valid (should always be?)
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.13
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - excluded `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` as they both does the same
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.12
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - renamed `spawn_table` to `spawn_chances` as tables are tables already and
      `spawn_chances` is more descriptive
    - added some more assertitions
    - added some minor debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.11
Date: 2025-06-07
  Fixed:
    - had to rename `stack-inserter` to `bulk-inserter` (thanks to @Dogman15 for reporting this)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.10
Date: 2025-04-26
  Fixes:
    - Parameter `size` was wrongfully documented as `number` must be `string`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.9
Date: 2025-04-19
  Changes:
    - The event `on_tick` did generate to many useless messages, it is now separated from
      usual debug purposes (EXTREMELY RARE USED!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.8
Date: 2025-04-18
  Fixes:
    - Possible fix for spawning ruins on heavy oil (Fulgora) or lava (Vulcanus)
      or anything not ground without using hard-coded planet names
    - the goal here is to allow Nauvis-like (water-based oceans) planets to have
      ruins spawned on without explicitly naming each planet and not spawning on anything
      that isn't a ground tile

  Changes:
    - more assertions added
    - more debug lines added (for checking if above fix works)
    - reformatted some one-line code
    - added debug messages and global runtime setting (map) for intense debugging
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.7
Date: 2025-04-12
  Fixes:
    - `mods` was/is a mod shorthand to `scripts.active_mods` and is not generic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 2025-04-12
  Changes:
    - added Fulgora and Vulcanus as excluded surface, the "water" there isn't
      detected correctly yet (see `@todo`), @mooklepticon and @Silly_Warlock reported it
    - renamed a few variables, e.g. `e` to `event` as I don't shorten anything
    - don't invoke these functions with invalid surfaces, otherwise you will get an assertion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.5
Date: 2025-03-28
  Fixes:
    - Finally fixed last error, thank you to @Arrevax for reporting it (I saw here, too)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-03-28

Date: 2025-03-27

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2025-03-27

    - missed to change these, too (yes small ruins isn't still a loop)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-03-27
  Fixes:
    - ops, need to add curly braces here, it is a list/array
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fixes:
    - defenses will now attack hostile buildings (thank you to @Dran_____ for reporting and @Silly_Warlock
