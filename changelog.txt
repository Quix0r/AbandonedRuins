---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.13
Date: 2025-11-27
  Fixed:
    - a long, chained code has caused a `nil` type which caused a raised error in `spawning.spawn_random_ruin()`
      as the first parameter has to be `table`. Thanks to @gizzum for reporting it.
    - ops, `#foos` doesn't work when `foos` is a table, need to use `utils.table_size()` instead
  Changes:
    - library `ruinsets`'s functions now check on size of ruin-sets, empty tables are being rejected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.12
Date: 2025-11-26
  Changes:
    - no spawning allowed/wanted in "labs" aka. Sandboxes, thanks to @somethingtohide for making me
      aware of this flag
  Fixed:
    - wrong configuration key specified
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.11
Date: 2025-11-26
  Bugfixes:
    - `storage.excluded` might not have been initialized (my mistake putting it into `get_all_excluded()`)
      thanks to @toynbeeidea for reporting it
    - bumped Factorio version to 2.0.72 (latest patch)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.10
Date: 2025-11-24
  Bugfixes:
    - wrong/old name `ruin_sets` used, the library's name is `ruinsets`
    - `utils.get_ruin_name()` has returned the ruin, not the fixed name
  Changes:
    - introduced debugging of utlities "class"
    - Introduced function `ruinsets.isset()` which checks if a ruin-set with given name is loaded
    - moved temporary `surfaces.excluded` to persisted `storage` so mods like
      BluePrint have it easier
    - registered on event `on_pre_surface_deleted` to re-include a now being
      destroyed surface from the index. This reduces a bit save-game size
    - added debug lines to `utils.get_enemy_force()`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.9
Date: 2025-11-20
  Bugfix:
    - fixed `utilities.lua:88: bad argument #4 of 5 to 'format' (number expected, got nil)`
  Bugfix (potential):
    - `game.surfaces[name]` might not be initialized at some point
  Minor:
    - Accidently left in some old-lost code `ruin_sets[]='%s'` as `exclude/reinclude_surface`
      only has one parameter
  Documentation:
    - added documentation `SURFACES-PLANETS.md` with code snippets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.8
Date: 2025-11-02
  Changes:
    - moved events and their functiosn to lua/events.lua
    - also need to move `try_ruin_spawn()` to `spawning` "class"
    - removed exclusion list from `queue.add_ruin()` function to avoid permanent loop
    - removed check on `spawning.ruin_sizes` from spawning.lua to avoid permanent loop
    - moved `_ruin_sets` "map" to new "class" `lua/ruinsets.lua`
  API:
    - added remote-call function `get_ruin_sets()` for getting all ruin-sets, type: `table<string, RuinSet>`
  Minor:
    - added log message
    - added internal TODO: If you want a "planet"/surface being blacklisted (nothing being spawned)
      I won't add it to `surfaces.excluded` list for you, please invoke remote-call function
      `exclude_surface` if your surface isn't a planet' surface (e.g. NiceFill has such "hidden"
      surface) or `no_spawning_on()` for each ruin-set individually
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.7
Date: 2025-09-27
  Bugfixes:
    - same check added in surfaces.lua (thanks to @reeverdark for reporting it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.6
Date: 2025-09-26
  Bugfixes:
    - added check for `game.surfaces[name]`, thanks to @FRESKYthefresh / @reeverdark for
      reporting it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.5
Date: 2025-09-08
  Bugfixes:
    - ops, no_spawning is for NOT spawning (denied), need to negate it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.4
Date: 2025-08-30
  Minor:
    - moved configuration key to `constants.lua`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.3
Date: 2025-08-28
  Bugfixes:
    - use `game.surfaces[name].planet` instead of some `data.raw` as the later one is not
      available on control phase
    - also added same checks in inner functions
    - renamed migrations (won't hurt)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.2
Date: 2025-08-27
  Minor:
    - moved icon graphics into own sub-directory
    - introduced spawning.allow_spawning_on() which checks if spawning on surface is allowed for
      given ruin-set name
    - renamed `surfaces.excluded_surfaces` to `excluded` as the 2nd `surfaces` would be redundant
    - introduced surfaces.is_excluded() which checks if surface name is in exclusion table, this
      should allow repeated remote-calls on "exclude_surface" and "reinclude_surface" without
      causing any crashes, but the "inner" function needs to check the exclusion status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 2025-08-25
  Minor:
    - introduced utils.list_contains() which checks if a certain value is present in given
      "list"
    - added some sanity-checks to make sure only valid parameters can pass
    - removed unused parameter `tick`, it was present in former release but now since
      on_nth_tick() is being waited on, the delay should be enough
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 2025-08-24
  Cleanup:
    - removed deprecated remote-call function "add_ruin_set". Please use "add_ruin_sets" with
      your whole ruin-set instead
  Breaking changes:
    - remote-call function "exclude_surface" was misused for excluding whole planets from spawning
      ruins of a certain set. This is not how it works. "exclude_surface" is for internal surfaces
      which mods such as "control-room" or `NiceFill` use to work.
    - so if you wish to exclude your ruin-set from a planet, use the remote-call function
      "no_spawning_on" instead. Or if you wish only a few ruins should not spawn on a certain planet
      add ed the `no_spawning` key to your ruin.
    - The mod `AbandonedRuins-base` provides all needed documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.18
Date: 2025-08-06
  Bugfixes:
    - need to run `init()` also during `on_load` as `spawn_changes` and others are now moved away,
      thanks to @Silly_Warlock for mentioning this
    - remote-call function "register_ruin_set" wasn't possible, so please remain with utilities
      function instead
  Minor:
    - introduced wrapper function `utils.output_message()` to avoid crashes due to missing `game`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.17
Date: 2025-08-06
  Features:
    - [s]added remote-call function "register_ruin_set" which wraps around same function in file
      `lua/utilities.lua`. So no need to `require()` that script anymore[/s]
  Minor:
    - moved `storage.exclusive_ruinset` to `spawning` "class/library" to clear some space in
      game-save file (storage is persisted)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.16
Date: 2025-08-05
  Minor:
    - Added deprecation message so the player can see it, including ruin-set name
    - reformatted some debug lines
    - renamed `recipe` to `recipe_name` as this is only the name and not full `LuaRecipe`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.15
Date: 2025-08-05
  Bugfixes:
    - tpzo fixed in variable name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.14
Date: 2025-08-04
  Minor:
    - moved `spawn_chances` table from storage to local lua/spawning.lua "class'" property
    - moved `ruin_sizes` table to lua/spawning.lua` "class`" property
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.13
Date: 2025-08-03
  Performance:
    - `on_tick` was to much, now it can be configured how often a ruin should be attempted to spawn
  Rewrites:
    - moved queue (ruins) handling to own LUA "class/library"
    - moved excluding/reincluding surfaces to own LUA "class/library"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.12
Date: 2025-08-03
  Bugfixes:
    - when no ruin-set is installed the default was "base" which is already a ruin-set's name
    - replacing "base" with "__none__" and then excluding it from being handled solves a crash
      reported by @sidfu1 and confirmed by @xyzzycgn
  Minor:
    - added more paths (e.g. `.DS_Store` is from MacOS) to be ignored
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.11
Date: 2025-07-27
  Bugfixes:
    - skip creating debug world surface when no ruin-set was loaded (e.g. only this mod installed)
    - local variable `mgs` was pointless as it only caused more memory usage and was used only once
    - moved `excluded_surfaces` to temporary local variable, it shouldn't be persisted or else
      I cannot add new internal surfaces easily.
    - added more checks on array elements to avoid crashes with `?` and `nil` only which are
      hard to debug
    - handle missing ruin-set while it is still configured. This might be the case when a mod
      failed to properly load its ruin-sets
    - use constants.ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG_KEY instead of hard-coded string (recommended for mod devs)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.10
Date: 2025-07-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Event registrations can only be one function at a time. So if you register two to the
      same event the later one overwrites the other one, thanks to @Silly_Warlock pointing this
      out
  Minor:
    - added function name to error messages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.9
Date: 2025-07-27
  Features:
    - `add_ruin_size()` now has a 2nd parameter, `half_size` (uint) which will be added/updated
      in table `utils.ruin_half_sizes`
    - added another debug message
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed logic error in fluid handling in `safe_insert_fluid()`, thanks to @Silly_Warlock
      pointing it out
    - got rid of local copies of `prototypes.fluid` and `entity.insert_fluid()`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.8
Date: 2025-07-24
  Features:
    - Allow ruin-set mods to mark their whole mod exclusively to one or more surfaces
    - introduced `utils.get_ruin_name()` which will return "unknown" if the ruin doesn't have
      a key "name" set or otherwise that key is returned
  Minor:
    - added surface "NiceFill" to excluded surfaces as this is only an "internal"
      hidden surface
    - more/improved debug messages like ruin-set's name
  Documentation:
    - removed `docs/ruin_sets.md` as its place is now in `AbandonedRuins-base` mod
    - updated link to github's "blob" URL
    - updated links to updated `ruin-maker` mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.7
Date: 2025-07-22
  Rewrites:
    - some ruins might contain only tiles to spawn (e.g. `heart.lua` in "base"). They are now
      correctly spawned (thanks to @Silly_Warlock for reporting this)
    - only invoke `spawn_entities()` when there is something to spawn
  Minor:
    - `spawn_ruin()`: logged amount of variables about to be parsed, entities and tiles about
      to be spawned
    - logging `table_size(ruin.entities)` might crash the game as it might be `nil` again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.6
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfix for bugfix:
    - ops!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.5
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfixes:
    - cannot log `entity.name` as the parameter `entity` might be a string, too ... :-(
    - reverted back last change ... (?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.4
Date: 2025-07-22
  Bugfixes:
    - `settings.global` isn't available during "settings" phase, it has to be
      `data.raw["string-setting"]` for `current-ruin-set` setting.
    - entities need to be destroyed regardless if they are valid or not
    - still logging an invalid entity isn't possible, so logging needs to distinguish this
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.3
Date: 2025-07-22
  Features:
    - moved `register_ruin_set()` from non-working `remote.call()` to `lua/utilities.lua`.
      You now have to "include" that script instead. See mod `realistic-ruins-updated` for
      an example.
  Documentation:
    - moved `format.md` to `AbandonedRuins-base` as that is the proper place it
    - updated other documentation files for reflecting the split of the mods
  Bugfixes:
    - Need to add previous size's threshold, not current again (thanks to @Silly_Warlock for
      reporting this
    - my debug message crashed the game when logging `entity.type/name` when an invalid entity
      was found
    - added braces to `count_tiles_filtered()` invocation as this is a function to be invoked
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 2025-07-21
  Features:
    - added remote-call function `register_ruin_set` for avoiding hard-coded access on writing
      mod configuration in other mods (lesser porting)
  Improvements/bugfixes:
    - used more `table_size(my_table)` as `#my_table` is undecided size LUA 5.2
    - fixed all `default-ruin-set` to `current-ruin-set`
    - added more debug lines
    - used counter variable for indexed (numeric) tables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2025-07-20
  Changes:
    - fixed bug in `spawn_ruin()` as the keyword `local` was twice, causing the variable's scope
      being intitialized again inside the `if()` block and the outside variable is NOT updated
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - renamed mod to `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` done by @Keysivi
    - renamed settings from `AbandonedRuins-*` to `ruins-*`, `current-ruin-set` is now where other
      ruin-sets can be added to
    - removed base ruins (duplicated to mod `AbandonedRuins-base`)
    - further rewrites towards `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` mod
    - excluded my old mod's name
    - added asserts on surface.valid (should always be?)
    - added more debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.13
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - excluded `AbandonedRuins_updated_fork` as they both does the same
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.12
Date: 2025-07-18
  Changes:
    - renamed `spawn_table` to `spawn_chances` as tables are tables already and
      `spawn_chances` is more descriptive
    - added some more assertitions
    - added some minor debug lines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.11
Date: 2025-06-07
  Fixed:
    - had to rename `stack-inserter` to `bulk-inserter` (thanks to @Dogman15 for reporting this)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.10
Date: 2025-04-26
  Fixes:
    - Parameter `size` was wrongfully documented as `number` must be `string`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.9
Date: 2025-04-19
  Changes:
    - The event `on_tick` did generate to many useless messages, it is now separated from
      usual debug purposes (EXTREMELY RARE USED!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.8
Date: 2025-04-18
  Fixes:
    - Possible fix for spawning ruins on heavy oil (Fulgora) or lava (Vulcanus)
      or anything not ground without using hard-coded planet names
    - the goal here is to allow Nauvis-like (water-based oceans) planets to have
      ruins spawned on without explicitly naming each planet and not spawning on anything
      that isn't a ground tile

  Changes:
    - more assertions added
    - more debug lines added (for checking if above fix works)
    - reformatted some one-line code
    - added debug messages and global runtime setting (map) for intense debugging
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.7
Date: 2025-04-12
  Fixes:
    - `mods` was/is a mod shorthand to `scripts.active_mods` and is not generic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 2025-04-12
  Changes:
    - added Fulgora and Vulcanus as excluded surface, the "water" there isn't
      detected correctly yet (see `@todo`), @mooklepticon and @Silly_Warlock reported it
    - renamed a few variables, e.g. `e` to `event` as I don't shorten anything
    - don't invoke these functions with invalid surfaces, otherwise you will get an assertion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.5
Date: 2025-03-28
  Fixes:
    - Finally fixed last error, thank you to @Arrevax for reporting it (I saw here, too)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 2025-03-28
  Fixes:
    - renamed `<l|m|s>_runins` variable to only `ruins`
    - ops, need to insert each small ruin ... ;-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2025-03-27
  Fixes:
    - more curly braces added (table/list/array, not single parameters)

  Changes:
    - converted many table.insert() into a for in pairs() loop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2025-03-27
  Fixes:
    - missed to change these, too (yes small ruins isn't still a loop)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-03-27
  Fixes:
    - ops, need to add curly braces here, it is a list/array
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-03-27
  Fixes:
    - defenses will now attack hostile buildings (thank you to @Dran_____ for reporting and @Silly_Warlock
      for the fix!

  Changes:
    - moved ruins lua code as they are strictly seen no entities or items to directory `lua`
    - same with spawning.lua and utilities.lua

    - ops, missed return keyword, better performance now
    - renamed <small|medium|large>Ruins.lua to <small|medium|large>/__init__.lua

    - rewrote 3 duplicated lines to a simple loop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.22
Date: 2025-02-16

    - no assert here, else module inserter plans won't work (and maybe others, too)
    - still some debug log around!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.21
